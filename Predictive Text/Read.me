I did a project that will generate random characters, and based on a reading of another text, it will be able to store the most commom following letters.

so the steps are:
1. Read a text, identify its patterns, and store for each letter its most commons following letters.
2. with this data, take a random character to be the first one (beacon), and use the data of the follow letters to generate the rest of the text
3. depending on how much letters you stick together to predict the following letters, more easy it will be to generate words that really exist.
    (for example: the following letters of "a" could be (n,m,b,t, and other ....) but if you look for "as" or "ast" the variety reduces. 
4. Finally, i generalized the code so the user which number of letters the user can stick together.
